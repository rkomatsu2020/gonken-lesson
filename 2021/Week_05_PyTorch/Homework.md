# Homework

## 1st homework
- due to **Nov.11, 2020**
- train your model with face_dataset3 at least 1 time.
- you can use `01_classification.ipynb`, and make some comments on it.

## 2nd homework
- due to Nov.18, 2020

The main task is to conduct the classification of footwear including (sandals, sneakers, and ankle boots) with `fashion_dataset2`.
*Dataset* function should be changed to obtain only classes regarding footwear.
And also I would like to know the performance of [Residual Block], so compare the results of the following models: (1) CNN model which is used in the first lecture (you can modify if you want). (2) The model which has Residual Block prior to the convolutional block of the 1st model.

- In short, your works will be:
  - make *Dataset* function.
  - implement Residual Block and merge it into the model we've built.
  - compare the performances of 2 models.
