## Overview

1. Python 1
 - Data importing and preparation with Pandas
 - Simple plotting with Matplotlib
 - Introduction to Vim
2. Python 2
 - Importing datasets with Pytorch
 - Building, training and loading models with Pytorch
 - Building a model from a diagram or table with Pytorch
3. Gradient descent
 - Fundamentals of gradient-based optimization methods
 - SGD and batches
 - Other gradient methods
 - Backpropagation
4. Regularization in deep networks
 - Principle and purpose of regularization
	- reducing search space, restricting solutions
	- equivalent to a Bayesian prior
 - Weight regularizers
 - Batch normalization
 - Loss-based regularization (total variance, etc.)
5. Parameter sharing
 - Invariance in functions, with examples
 - Parameter sharing as a way to represent invariance
 - Parameter sharing as a form of regularization
6. Convolution
 - The convolution operation
 - The transposed convolution operation
 - Uses, advantages and restrictions of convolutional layers
7. Hyperparameter optimization
 - Making your own hyperparameter optimization algorithms with Scipy 
 - Practical application
