## Lesson Procedure
##### Before 1st lecture:
1. Give the reading list to student (Any book, paper or link)
2. Complete the lecture materials 4 days before the 1st lecture, and upload to Github.

##### During 1st lecture: 
1. Explain the topic. 
2. Give the homework 

##### Between the 1st lecture and 2nd lecture: 
1. Answer the questions from students about the topic or the homework. (via email)

##### During 2nd lecture: 
1. Answer the questions from students about the topic or the homework. (via zoom, face to face)
2. Explain the high-frequency questions if there are questions which many students asked. 
3. At the end of 2nd lecture, the next tutor gives the next reading list to student. 

##### After the 2nd lecture: 
1. Answer the questions from students about the topic or the homework. (via email)
